# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to view and edit existing expenses from the recent expenses list. Users can click on any expense item to navigate to a detailed view that initially displays all expense information in a read-only format. An edit mode allows users to modify all expense details except the group assignment, while preserving all existing "create expense" functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on an expense item from the recent expenses list, so that I can view its complete details in a dedicated screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any expense item in the recent expenses list THEN the system SHALL navigate to an expense detail screen
2. WHEN the expense detail screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the screen title as "Expense Detail" or similar
3. WHEN the expense detail screen loads THEN the system SHALL populate all expense fields with the existing expense data
4. WHEN the expense detail screen loads THEN all expense fields SHALL be displayed in read-only mode initially

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit an existing expense's details, so that I can correct or update expense information when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the expense detail screen is displayed THEN the system SHALL show an "Edit" button in the top right position
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Edit" button THEN the system SHALL enable editing mode for all expense fields except the group field
3. WHEN editing mode is active THEN the group field SHALL remain locked and uneditable
4. WHEN editing mode is active THEN all other expense fields SHALL become editable with the same validation rules as create expense
5. WHEN editing mode is active THEN the system SHALL provide save and cancel options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expense detail functionality to coexist with create expense functionality, so that both features work independently without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing expense detail view THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing "create expense" page functionality
2. WHEN implementing expense detail view THEN the system SHALL not alter any existing create expense workflows
3. WHEN implementing expense detail view THEN the system SHALL reuse appropriate components from create expense where possible
4. WHEN a user navigates between create expense and expense detail screens THEN both SHALL function independently without data interference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save changes made to an expense, so that my updates are persisted and reflected throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes changes in edit mode and saves THEN the system SHALL validate all modified fields using existing validation rules
2. WHEN validation passes and save is confirmed THEN the system SHALL update the expense in the backend
3. WHEN an expense is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the recent expenses list to reflect changes
4. WHEN an expense is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL return to read-only mode in the expense detail view
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without saving changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to cancel editing changes, so that I can discard unwanted modifications and return to the original expense data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is in edit mode THEN the system SHALL provide a cancel option
2. WHEN a user clicks cancel THEN the system SHALL discard all unsaved changes
3. WHEN cancel is confirmed THEN the system SHALL restore all fields to their original values
4. WHEN cancel is confirmed THEN the system SHALL return to read-only mode
