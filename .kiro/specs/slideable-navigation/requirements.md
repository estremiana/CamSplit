# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current navigation system from a traditional page-based navigation to a smooth, slideable interface. Users will be able to swipe horizontally between the three main pages (Dashboard, Groups, Profile) while maintaining the existing bottom navigation bar functionality. The navigation will support both gesture-based swiping and tap-based navigation through the bottom bar, with proper icon display and smooth transitions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to swipe horizontally between the main pages (Dashboard, Groups, Profile), so that I can quickly navigate through the app with intuitive gestures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user swipes left on the Dashboard page THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the Groups page
2. WHEN the user swipes left on the Groups page THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the Profile page
3. WHEN the user swipes right on the Groups page THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the Dashboard page
4. WHEN the user swipes right on the Profile page THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to the Groups page
5. WHEN the user is on the Dashboard page and swipes right THEN the system SHALL NOT navigate to any other page
6. WHEN the user is on the Profile page and swipes left THEN the system SHALL NOT navigate to any other page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the bottom navigation bar to remain functional and synchronized with the current page, so that I can still use tap navigation while having visual feedback of my current location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps on the Dashboard icon in the bottom bar THEN the system SHALL slide to the Dashboard page
2. WHEN the user taps on the Groups icon in the bottom bar THEN the system SHALL slide to the Groups page
3. WHEN the user taps on the Profile icon in the bottom bar THEN the system SHALL slide to the Profile page
4. WHEN the user navigates to any page via swipe gesture THEN the bottom navigation bar SHALL update to highlight the correct icon
5. WHEN transitioning between pages THEN the bottom navigation bar SHALL remain visible and functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the "Welcome back + name" button on the dashboard to navigate to the profile page with the same sliding animation, so that the navigation experience is consistent throughout the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps on the "Welcome back + name" button on the Dashboard THEN the system SHALL slide through the pages to reach the Profile page
2. WHEN navigating via the welcome button THEN the transition SHALL be visually smooth and consistent with swipe navigation
3. WHEN the profile page is reached via the welcome button THEN the bottom navigation bar SHALL highlight the Profile icon

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the correct icons in the bottom navigation bar at all times, so that I have clear visual indicators of the available navigation options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN all bottom navigation icons SHALL display their correct icons immediately
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the icons SHALL remain properly displayed without showing placeholder "?" icons
3. WHEN an icon is in the active state THEN it SHALL display the filled version of the icon
4. WHEN an icon is in the inactive state THEN it SHALL display the outlined version of the icon
5. WHEN the system loads icons THEN there SHALL be no delay or placeholder icons visible to the user

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive page transitions, so that the navigation feels natural and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transitioning between pages THEN the animation duration SHALL be between 200-400 milliseconds
2. WHEN swiping between pages THEN the transition SHALL follow the user's finger movement in real-time
3. WHEN releasing a swipe gesture THEN the page SHALL snap to the nearest complete page position
4. WHEN multiple navigation actions occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without visual glitches
5. WHEN transitioning between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on supported devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the page state to be preserved when navigating between pages, so that I don't lose my scroll position or form data when switching between sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls on a page and navigates away THEN the scroll position SHALL be preserved when returning
2. WHEN the user has form data entered and navigates away THEN the form state SHALL be maintained when returning
3. WHEN the user returns to a previously visited page THEN the page SHALL display in the same state as when they left
4. WHEN the system manages page state THEN it SHALL not cause memory leaks or performance degradation
