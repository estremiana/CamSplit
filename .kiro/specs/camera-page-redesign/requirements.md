# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the camera page for receipt capture in the CamSplit app to provide a more professional and functional user experience. The current implementation has several UX issues including non-functional UI elements, excessive screen real estate usage by tips, fake detection features, and poor navigation behavior. This redesign will create a streamlined, functional camera interface that actually works with device hardware and provides meaningful feedback to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user taking a photo of a receipt, I want a clean and functional camera interface, so that I can quickly capture receipts without being distracted by unnecessary UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera page loads THEN the camera preview SHALL display the actual device camera feed instead of a grey placeholder
2. WHEN the user opens the camera page THEN the tips section SHALL be minimized or collapsible to maximize camera preview space
3. WHEN the user interacts with the tips section THEN they SHALL be able to expand/collapse it to control screen real estate
4. WHEN the camera preview is active THEN it SHALL occupy the majority of the screen space for optimal framing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user taking photos in various lighting conditions, I want functional camera controls, so that I can capture clear images of receipts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the flash button THEN the device flash SHALL toggle on/off and the button state SHALL reflect the current flash setting
2. WHEN the flash is enabled THEN the flash button SHALL show a visual indicator of the active state
3. WHEN the user takes a photo with flash enabled THEN the device flash SHALL fire during capture
4. WHEN the camera preview is active THEN standard camera controls SHALL be functional and responsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user capturing receipt images, I want accurate feedback about image quality, so that I can ensure the receipt will be readable for processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera detects a rectangular document-like shape THEN it SHALL show a detection overlay only if a receipt is actually detected
2. WHEN no receipt is detected THEN no detection overlay SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN a receipt is detected THEN the detection overlay SHALL accurately outline the detected document boundaries
4. WHEN the detection confidence is low THEN the system SHALL not show false positive detection indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user reviewing captured images, I want a clean and simple review interface, so that I can quickly decide whether to keep or retake the photo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is captured THEN the review screen SHALL display the captured image clearly without fake quality assessment buttons
2. WHEN reviewing the captured image THEN the user SHALL have clear options to either keep the photo or retake it
3. WHEN the user is satisfied with the image THEN they SHALL be able to proceed to the next step easily
4. WHEN the user wants to retake the photo THEN they SHALL be able to return to the camera capture screen quickly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who has captured a receipt image, I want to crop and adjust the image boundaries, so that I can ensure only the relevant receipt content is processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is captured THEN the user SHALL have the option to crop/cut the image before proceeding
2. WHEN the user chooses to crop the image THEN they SHALL be presented with an image cropping interface
3. WHEN using the cropping interface THEN the user SHALL be able to adjust the boundaries of the receipt area
4. WHEN the user confirms the crop THEN the system SHALL process only the cropped portion of the image
5. WHEN the user skips cropping THEN the system SHALL use the full captured image for processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user navigating the camera interface, I want consistent and intuitive navigation behavior, so that I can easily move between screens without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the back button on the camera page THEN they SHALL be taken to the previous screen in the navigation stack
2. WHEN the user presses the back button on the photo review screen THEN it SHALL function the same as the "retake" button
3. WHEN the user chooses to retake a photo THEN they SHALL return to the camera capture screen with the camera active
4. WHEN the user navigates back from photo review THEN the previous photo SHALL be discarded and camera preview SHALL resume
5. WHEN the user completes the photo capture process THEN they SHALL proceed to the next logical step in the receipt processing flow
