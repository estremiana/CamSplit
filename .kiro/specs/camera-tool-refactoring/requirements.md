# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the camera functionality in the SplitEase app to create a reusable camera tool that can be used across different parts of the application. Currently, the camera is tightly coupled with the receipt scanning workflow, which causes issues when trying to use camera functionality for other purposes like expense images, group images, and profile images. This refactoring will separate the camera tool from specific workflows and create a flexible, reusable component that can handle image capture, cropping, and upload for various use cases throughout the app.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reusable camera tool component, so that I can use the same camera functionality across different parts of the app without duplicating code or creating workflow conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera tool is invoked THEN it SHALL operate independently of any specific workflow (receipt scanning, expense creation, etc.)
2. WHEN the camera tool completes its operation THEN it SHALL return image data and/or upload URL to the calling component
3. WHEN the camera tool is used THEN it SHALL not automatically navigate to workflow-specific pages like item extraction
4. WHEN the camera tool is integrated THEN it SHALL support multiple use cases: expense images, group images, profile images, and receipt scanning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user taking photos for expenses, I want to use the same camera interface that I use for receipt scanning, so that I have a consistent experience across the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access camera functionality from expense creation THEN I SHALL see the same camera interface used for receipt scanning
2. WHEN I capture an image for an expense THEN I SHALL be able to crop, retake, or use the image
3. WHEN I confirm an expense image THEN the image SHALL be uploaded and I SHALL return to the expense creation flow
4. WHEN I cancel or go back from expense image capture THEN I SHALL return to the expense creation screen without any image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user setting up a group, I want to use the camera tool to capture or select a group image, so that I can personalize my group with a photo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose to add a group image THEN I SHALL be able to access the camera tool
2. WHEN I capture or select a group image THEN I SHALL be able to crop and adjust it before confirming
3. WHEN I confirm a group image THEN the image SHALL be uploaded and set as the group image
4. WHEN I cancel group image selection THEN I SHALL return to the group setup without changing the group image

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user updating my profile, I want to use the camera tool to capture or select a profile picture, so that I can personalize my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose to update my profile picture THEN I SHALL be able to access the camera tool
2. WHEN I capture or select a profile image THEN I SHALL be able to crop it to fit profile picture requirements
3. WHEN I confirm a profile image THEN the image SHALL be uploaded and set as my profile picture
4. WHEN I cancel profile image selection THEN I SHALL return to the profile screen without changing my profile picture

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user scanning receipts, I want the receipt scanning workflow to use the refactored camera tool, so that I have the same camera experience but with receipt-specific processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access receipt scanning THEN I SHALL use the same camera interface as other camera functions
2. WHEN I capture a receipt image THEN the camera tool SHALL return the image to the receipt scanning workflow
3. WHEN the receipt scanning workflow receives the image THEN it SHALL automatically process it through the item extraction API
4. WHEN receipt processing is complete THEN I SHALL be taken to the expense creation screen with extracted items

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the camera tool to handle image upload consistently, so that all images are stored and accessible in the same way regardless of their purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is captured or selected through the camera tool THEN it SHALL be uploaded to the appropriate storage location
2. WHEN an image upload is successful THEN the camera tool SHALL return the image URL and/or file reference
3. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the camera tool SHALL provide error feedback and retry options
4. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL handle different image types and sizes appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent navigation behavior when using the camera tool, so that I always know how to return to where I came from.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the camera tool from any screen THEN the back button SHALL return me to that originating screen
2. WHEN I complete the camera tool workflow THEN I SHALL be returned to the appropriate next screen for that use case
3. WHEN I cancel the camera tool operation THEN I SHALL be returned to the originating screen without any changes
4. WHEN using the camera tool THEN the navigation stack SHALL be managed properly to prevent unexpected navigation behavior

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the camera tool to support both taking new photos and selecting existing images, so that I have flexibility in how I provide images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the camera tool THEN I SHALL have options to take a new photo or select from gallery
2. WHEN I select an existing image from gallery THEN I SHALL be able to crop and adjust it the same way as captured photos
3. WHEN I take a new photo THEN I SHALL be able to retake it if I'm not satisfied
4. WHEN I select or capture an image THEN I SHALL have consistent cropping and confirmation options
