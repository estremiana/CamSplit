# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The settlement optimization feature implements an intelligent debt resolution system that minimizes the number of transactions needed to settle all debts within a group. Instead of having multiple overlapping debts between users, the system calculates optimal settlements where each user has at most one payment to make or receive. When a settlement is marked as "settled," it converts into an expense record for tracking purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a group member, I want the system to automatically calculate optimal settlements, so that I can see the minimum number of transactions needed to settle all debts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expenses are added, modified, or removed THEN the system SHALL recalculate all settlements dynamically
2. WHEN multiple users owe money to each other THEN the system SHALL optimize to minimize the total number of required transactions
3. WHEN a user owes money to multiple people THEN the system SHALL consolidate these into optimal settlement paths
4. IF user A owes user B and user B owes user C THEN the system SHALL create a direct settlement from user A to user C when possible

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a group member, I want to view all current settlements, so that I can understand who owes money to whom after optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the settlements page THEN the system SHALL display all current optimal settlements
2. WHEN displaying settlements THEN the system SHALL show the debtor, creditor, and amount for each settlement
3. WHEN no settlements are needed THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating all debts are settled
4. WHEN settlements exist THEN the system SHALL provide a clear action to mark each settlement as completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a group member, I want to mark a settlement as "settled," so that it becomes a permanent expense record and is removed from active settlements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I mark a settlement as settled THEN the system SHALL create a new expense record
2. WHEN creating the settled expense THEN the system SHALL set the debtor as the payer and the creditor as the only participant
3. WHEN creating the settled expense THEN the system SHALL use the settlement amount as the expense amount
4. WHEN a settlement is marked as settled THEN the system SHALL remove it from the active settlements list
5. WHEN a settlement is marked as settled THEN the system SHALL recalculate remaining settlements
6. WHEN I click on a settlement THEN the system SHALL display a modal to confirm the action before marking it as settled

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a group member, I want settlements to update in real-time, so that I always see the current optimal debt structure when expenses change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an expense is added THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate and update settlements
2. WHEN an expense is modified THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate and update settlements
3. WHEN an expense is deleted THEN the system SHALL immediately recalculate and update settlements
4. WHEN settlements are recalculated THEN the system SHALL preserve any existing settlement records that haven't changed
5. WHEN settlements are recalculated THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the new settlement state

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want settlement calculations to be performant, so that users don't experience delays when making expense changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating settlements for groups with up to 50 members THEN the system SHALL complete calculations within 2 seconds
2. WHEN settlement calculations fail THEN the system SHALL display an error message and maintain the previous settlement state
3. WHEN multiple expense changes occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL debounce calculations to avoid excessive processing
4. IF settlement calculation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a group member, I want to see settlement history, so that I can track which settlements have been completed over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view settlement history THEN the system SHALL display all previously settled transactions
2. WHEN displaying settlement history THEN the system SHALL show the settlement date, amount, debtor, and creditor
3. WHEN displaying settlement history THEN the system SHALL link to the corresponding expense record created from the settlement
4. WHEN viewing settlement history THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range and participants
5. WHEN viewing group details THEN the system SHALL display the pending settlements
6. WHEN viewing group details THEN the system SHALL display an option to view settlement history
