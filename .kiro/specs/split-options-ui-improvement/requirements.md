# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves improving the split options UI design in the SplitEase expense creation screen. The current split options widget needs to be updated with a more modern, user-friendly design that provides better visual feedback and improved user experience for selecting how expenses should be split among group members.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating an expense, I want an improved split options interface, so that I can easily understand and select how to divide the expense among participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the split options THEN the system SHALL display three split types (Equal, Percentage, Custom) in a modern tabbed or segmented control design
2. WHEN the user selects a split type THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate colors and icons
3. WHEN the user selects "Equal Split" THEN the system SHALL show member selection with avatars and clear visual indicators
4. WHEN the user selects "Percentage Split" THEN the system SHALL show percentage input fields with real-time total validation
5. WHEN the user selects "Custom Split" THEN the system SHALL show custom amount input fields with total amount validation

### Requirement 2

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects members for equal split THEN the system SHALL show selected state with checkmarks and color coding
2. WHEN the user enters percentages THEN the system SHALL display running total and highlight when total doesn't equal 100%
3. WHEN the user enters custom amounts THEN the system SHALL validate that total matches the expense amount
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with appropriate styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive member selection interface, so that I can easily choose who participates in the expense split.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing member selection THEN the system SHALL display member avatars, names, and selection status
2. WHEN selecting/deselecting members THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN members are selected THEN the system SHALL show member count and calculated amounts
4. WHEN no members are selected THEN the system SHALL prevent proceeding with validation
